This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.5.
I used the API from https://openweathermap.org/ to get all the weather info.
I made city list json file where all city names are listed (and putted them in <select> with help of ngModel).
Depending on the weather, website background changes as you can see on the screenshots.<br/>
# How to run the app?<br/>

Run `npm install` to download node modules in order to run the project.
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
