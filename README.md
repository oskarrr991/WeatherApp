# WeatherApp

This project was generated with Angular CLI version 6.1.5.  I used the API from https://openweathermap.org/ to get all the weather info. I made city list json file where all city names are listed (and putted them in with help of ngModel). Depending on the weather, website background changes as you can see on the screenshots. How to run the app? Run npm install to download node modules in order to run the project. Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
