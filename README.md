# WeatherApp

This project was generated with Angular CLI version 6.1.5.<br/>
I used the API from https://openweathermap.org/ to get all the weather info.<br/>
I made city list json file where all city names are listed (and putted them into the select tag with help of ngModel).<br/>
Depending on the weather, website background changes as you can see on the screenshots.<br/>
# How to run the app?<br/> 
Run npm install to download node modules in order to run the project.<br/> 
Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/.<br/> 
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.<br/>
